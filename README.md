Our Route Planner & Weather Assistant offers smart route planning with custom preferences using the A* algorithm and HERE Technologies API for maps and weather data. The app features a responsive, modern UI built with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Users can check real-time weather, explore routes in 3D using third-party map rendering APIs, and seamlessly switch between planning and weather views without losing data. It supports video calls with local guides via external video APIs, and enables automated hotel and taxi bookings using Twilio/Bland APIs, with email confirmations sent through Firebase. The platform also includes LLM-powered itinerary planning and image classification to identify places like temples, hotels, and gas stations, enhancing route customization and travel discovery.
