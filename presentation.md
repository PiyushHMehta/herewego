# Route Planner & Weather Assistant â€“ Presentation

## Problem Statement

Travelers often face uncertainty when planning routes, especially regarding:
- Choosing the best route based on preferences (e.g., less tolls, less traffic, shortest, more restaurants/cultural sites).
- Checking weather conditions for their destination and travel dates.
- Keeping their planning workflow smooth and uninterrupted.

## Our Solution
